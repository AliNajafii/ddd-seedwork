# Domain Driven Design Framework for Python
This is a Domain Driven Design (DDD) framework for Python that consists of three layers: Application, Domain, and Infrastructure. The main goal of this framework is to provide a seedwork for developers to use in their services by gathering all required layer interfaces and classes.

## Key Concepts of DDD
Application Layer
The Application Layer is responsible for providing services to the outside world. It communicates with the Domain Layer to get the required information and processes it to fulfill the requests. This layer is responsible for managing the workflow of the application.

### Domain Layer
The Domain Layer is the core of the application. It contains the business logic, rules, and validations. It represents the real-world problem and provides the solution to it. This layer is independent of any infrastructure and communicates only with the Application Layer.

### Infrastructure Layer
The Infrastructure Layer provides the technical implementation of the application. It includes the database, external services, and other technical aspects. This layer communicates with both the Application Layer and the Domain Layer.

### Other Important Concepts
- Entities: Objects that have a unique identity and are important to the business.
- Value Objects: Objects that represent a concept or value without a unique identity.
- Aggregates: A group of entities and value objects that should be treated as a single unit.
- Repositories: Objects that handle the persistence of entities and value objects.
- Services: Objects that perform a specific operation that doesn't belong to any entity or value object.
- How to Use this Framework
- To use this framework, you need to implement the interfaces provided in each layer. The Application Layer interfaces are responsible for managing the workflow and - - - calling the Domain Layer interfaces. The Domain Layer interfaces are responsible for providing the business logic and rules. The Infrastructure Layer interfaces are - - responsible for the technical implementation of the application.

Once you have implemented the interfaces, you can use the classes provided in each layer to build your services. You can also extend the provided classes to add your own functionality.

## Conclusion
This framework provides a good starting point for building applications using the Domain Driven Design approach. It separates the concerns and provides a clear structure for the application.
